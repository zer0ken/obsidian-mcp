# Obsidian MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/obsidian-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/obsidian-mcp)

An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Obsidian vaults, providing tools for reading, creating, editing and managing notes and tags.

## Warning!!!

This MCP has read and write access (if you allow it). Please. PLEASE backup your Obsidian vault prior to using obsidian-mcp to manage your notes. I recommend using git, but any backup method will work. These tools have been tested, but not thoroughly, and this MCP is in active development.

## Features

- Read and search notes in your vault
- Create new notes and directories
- Edit existing notes
- Move and delete notes
- Manage tags (add, remove, rename)
- Search vault contents

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or higher (might work on lower, but I haven't tested it)
- An Obsidian vault

## Install

### Installing Manually

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "obsidian": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "obsidian-mcp", "/path/to/your/vault", "/path/to/your/vault2"]
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/vault` with the absolute path to your Obsidian vault. For example:

MacOS/Linux:

```json
"/Users/username/Documents/MyVault"
```

Windows:

```json
"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\MyVault"
```

Restart Claude for Desktop after saving the configuration. You should see the hammer icon appear, indicating the server is connected.

If you have connection issues, check the logs at:

- MacOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log`


### Installing via Smithery
Warning: I am not affiliated with Smithery. I have not tested using it and encourage users to install manually if they can.

To install Obsidian for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/obsidian-mcp):

Then add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "obsidian": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["<absolute-path-to-obsidian-mcp>/build/main.js", "/path/to/your/vault", "/path/to/your/vault2"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Security

This server requires access to your Obsidian vault directory. When configuring the server, make sure to:

- Only provide access to your intended vault directory
- Review tool actions before approving them

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. **Server not showing up in Claude Desktop**
   - Verify your configuration file syntax
   - Make sure the vault path is absolute and exists
   - Restart Claude Desktop

2. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure the vault path is readable/writable
   - Check file permissions in your vault
